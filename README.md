# pcm.zig

This is (or will be, eventually) a library for reading, writing, and working with PCM audio files (currently wav and
aiff).

It doesn't do much just yet other than read format info from file headers.

It's under active (but slow) development, and things will very likely break. Feel free to use it, but don't expect a
stable interface!
